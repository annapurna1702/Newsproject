The eyewall of the storm, known locally as Typhoon Karding, made landfall in the Polillo Islands at 5 p.m. local (5 a.m. ET) as a super typhoon and shortly afterwards hit the municipality of Burdeos, in Quezon Province, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). The storm had sustained winds of 240 kph (149 mph), with gusts up to 295 kph (183 mph) at that time, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It has since weakened slightly to a category 4 typhoon, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said in an update at around 9 a.m. ET., but is still causing an extremely dangerous winds, storm surge, extreme rainfall and catastrophic flooding in central Luzon. PAGASA reports that the typhoon is forecast to track westward in the next 6 to 12 hours, then west-northwestward for the rest of the day. There is a high to very high risk of storm surge more than 3 meters in height in the low-lying and exposed coastal areas of northern Quezon Province. Heavy rainfall is also forecast along the typhoon’s path in the coming hours. Under these conditions, widespread flooding and rain-induced landslides are expected, especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible, PAGASA said. Authorities previously issued an extreme emergency alert as the storm reached super typhoon status early on Sunday morning local time, after suddenly intensifying. “The highest emergency preparedness and response protocol has been activated in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, and the Bicol region,” said the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. It urged the public to take care, adding strong winds were expected to hit within the next 18 hours. Schools in multiple cities including Muntinlupa City and Aurora suspended classes for Monday, September 26, due to the approaching storm.'},

Thousands turned up to Arshad Sharif funeral on Thursday in Islamabad to mourn the well-known critic of Pakistan military. Opponents of the current Pakistani government believe that he was targeted in a plot organised in Pakistan. But Kenya police, in an initial report, said the 49-year-old was shot dead in a moving vehicle in a case of mistaken identity. Pakistan says it has sent investigators to Kenya to help with the inquiry into what took place. Late on Sunday evening, Sharif was a passenger in a Toyota Land Cruiser travelling on an unpaved rural road around 30km (20 miles) from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Shots were then fired at the vehicle by police, killing the journalist. But exactly why is not clear. The police have issued contradictory statements regarding the shooting. In one account, they say that Sharif was in a vehicle that was mistaken for one that had been reported stolen. The initial police report said officers were on the look-out for the missing vehicle when he was killed. According to this report, the driver of Sharif Land Cruiser disobeyed orders to stop at a roadblock and officers then shot at the car at least eight times as it moved away, killing the journalist in the process. In a second version of events from police, one of the people inside the vehicle fired first and then officers responded by shooting back. Police say one officer was hit in the hand as a result of the exchange of fire. It is not clear when Sharif first arrived in Kenya, or if he was travelling on a business or tourist visa. What is known however, is that he left Pakistan in August and had been in the United Arab Emirates and possibly the UK. Sharif was known as a vocal supporter of ousted Prime Minister Imran Khan and had complained of harassment before he left.'},

As Russia bombs its neighbor, what has become the biggest European war since 1945 has had an outsized impact far south, in the Middle East. A volatile region with an array of existing problems, the Middle East was no exception to the disruptions brought on by the conflict in Europe – with food shortages and inflation causing fear of political unrest amid a tug-of-war for allies between Russia and the West. But in other ways, some of the region’s countries have prospered immensely as the fighting rages on, adding hundreds of billions of dollars to their coffers. Here are four ways the Ukraine war has affected the Middle East over the last six months: Energy exporters are cashing in. The war has seen oil prices rise to as much as a 14-year high. That has resulted in soaring inflation and economic contraction globally, but for energy-rich Persian Gulf states, it’s good news coming after an eight-year economic slump caused by low oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the Middle East’s oil exporting states will make an additional $1.3 trillion in oil revenue in the next four years, it told the Financial Times last week. The extra money means Gulf states will have budget surpluses for the first time since 2014. Economic growth is also expected to significantly accelerate. In the first four months of this year, for example, the Saudi economy grew 9.9%, the highest in a decade. In stark contrast, the US economy shrank 1.5%. The war has also brought opportunities for the region’s gas producers. For decades, European countries opted to import gas from Russia via pipelines instead of having it shipped from faraway nations by sea. But as Europe weans itself off Russian gas, it’s looking for potential new partners to buy from. Qatar has pledged half of its total gas capacity to Europe in four years’ time. The EU has also signed gas deals with Egypt and Israel, both aspiring natural gas hubs in the region. And on a visit to Paris this month, UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan signed an agreement guaranteeing the UAE’s export of diesel to France. '},

It came after a US aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea to participate in joint drills, and ahead of a planned visit by Vice President Kamala Harris. Seoul said the launch was an "act of grave provocation". The UN prohibits North Korea from ballistic and nuclear weapons tests. South Koreas military said it detected a short range missile fired at just before 07:00 local time (23:00 GMT) close to Taechon, more than 100 km 60 miles north of Pyongyang. It said it flew about 600 km at an altitude of 60 km. Our military maintains a full readiness posture and is closely cooperating with the US while strengthening surveillance and vigilance, it said in a statement. Japan coast guard confirmed the launch, warning ships to be vigilant. Tokyo defence minister Yasukazu Hamada said the missile reached a maximum altitude of around 50 km, falling in waters off North Koreas eastern coast, and outside Japans exclusive economic zone. Its North Koreas way of showing defiance of the [US] alliance, Soo Kim, an analyst at the Rand Corporation, told AFP. The nuclear-powered USS Ronald Reagan docked in the southern port city of Busan on Friday, to take part in joint drills off South Korea east coast. The exercises are for the sake of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, according to the South Korean navy. Ms Harris will visit South Korea in the coming days as part of a trip to the region that will include the funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have spiked in the past year, with Pyongyang firing a number of ballistic missiles. South Korea President, Yoon Suk-yeol, who took office in May, has promised a tougher stance on North Korea and indicated closer ties with the US.'},

Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are bright, powerful emissions of radio waves ranging from a fraction of a millisecond to a few milliseconds, each producing energy equivalent to the sun’s annual output. Recent research suggested that some FRBs originate from magnetars, which are neutron stars with extremely powerful magnetic fields. A fast radio burst found in the Milky Way was associated with a magnetar, according to a 2020 study. But scientists haven’t yet pinpointed the origins of cosmological FRBs, which are very distant at billions of light-years away. It’s a quandary that led an international team of scientists to see what it could learn from observations of nearly 1,900 bursts from an active fast radio burst source outside our galaxy called FRB 20201124A, according to a study published September 21 in the journal Nature. The emissions associated with FRB 20201124A occurred for 82 hours over 54 days in the spring of 2021, making it one of the most active known fast radio bursts. It was visible through the world’s largest radio telescope – the China-based Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, or FAST. During the first 36 days, the study team was surprised to see irregular, short-time variations of the Faraday rotation measure, which measures the strength of the magnetic field and density of particles in the surroundings of FRB 20201124A. A larger rotation measure means the magnetic field near the radio burst’s source is stronger, denser or both, and a smaller measure means the opposite, Bing Zhang, a coauthor of the study and astrophysicist, said via email. “This is not reflective of the beginning of the FRB’s (life span),” said Zhang, the founding director of the Center for Astrophysics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “The FRB source has been there for a long time but has been dormant most of the time. It occasionally wakes up (this time for 54 days) and emits a lot of bursts.” The measures went up and down during that time period, then stopped during the last 18 days before the FRB dampened – “suggesting that the magnetic field strength and/or density along the line of sight in the vicinity of the FRB source are varying with time,” Zhang added. “It suggests that the environment of the FRB source is dynamically evolving, with rapidly changing magnetic fields or density or both.”'},

The SEC alleges that, following an October 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 Max jet that killed 189 people, Boeing and Muilenburg knew that part of the plane’s flight control system posed an ongoing safety concern yet told the public that the 737 Max was safe to fly. After a March 10, 2019 fatal 737 Max crash, the SEC alleges that Boeing and Muilenburg knowingly misled the public about “slips” and “gaps” in the certification process of that flight control system. In times of crisis and tragedy, it is especially important that public companies and executives provide full, fair, and truthful disclosures to the markets,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement. “The Boeing Company and its former CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, failed in this most basic obligation. They misled investors by providing assurances about the safety of the 737 MAX, despite knowing about serious safety concerns. In a statement, Boeing said that the settlement fully resolves the SEC’s previously disclosed inquiry into matters relating to the 737 MAX accidents. “Today’s settlement is part of the company’s broader effort to responsibly resolve outstanding legal matters related to the 737 MAX accidents in a manner that serves the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders,” Boeing said. The company and Muilenburg agreed to settle charges of violating the antifraud provisions of US securities laws, but they did not admit or deny the SEC’s allegations. Boeing agreed to pay a $200 million settlement and Muilenburg agreed to pay $1 million. Boeing and Muilenburg put profits over people by misleading investors about the safety of the 737 Max all in an effort to rehabilitate Boeing’s image following two tragic accidents that resulted in the loss of 346 lives and incalculable grief to so many families, said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division in a statement.'},

But a week later, he posted a video requesting strangers to stop bothering him and his family. I wish I had not won, he says. The third prize may have been better. Anoop says in the video that he is considering moving houses to escape the overwhelming public attention. He had made national headlines when he won the prize, the highest ever offered in the state for a lottery. He bought the ticket on 17 September - a day before he was supposed to fly to Malaysia for a job - after breaking open his son piggybank. After news broke of his win, his family received a lot of media attention.  I was overjoyed when I won, he says in his recent video. There were people and cameras at the house and we were happy. But the situation soon got out of control, he says. I cannot leave the house, I cannot go anywhere. My child is ill and I cannott take him to the doctor. Anoop - who will receive 150mn rupees after government taxes - says people begin arriving at his house every morning. All I can tell everyone is that I have not gotten any money yet. No-one seems to understand my problem, no matter how many times I say it," he says. The state government has said it will arrange a day training programme for Anoop on financial management to help him use the money well.'},

With global warming melting the sea ice the penguins depend on for their survival, the US Fish and Wildlife Service now categorizes the species as threatened. The federal agency lists “imperiled species as endangered or threatened regardless of their country of origin.” The Tuesday announcement came more than a year after an initial proposal by the service to protect emperor penguins under the ESA. Emperor penguins rely on sea ice to form their breeding colonies, avoid predators in the ocean and forage for food. But as Earth’s temperature rises in relation to greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions, sea ice is at risk of disappearing. When sea ice melts or breaks apart earlier in the season than expected due to global warming, entire penguin colonies can decline or disappear. “This listing reflects the growing extinction crisis and highlights the importance of the ESA and efforts to conserve species before population declines become irreversible,” said Martha Williams, US Fish and Wildlife Service director, in a statement. Parts of the Antarctic Peninsula’s sea ice have melted by more than 60% in 30 years, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. And if emperor penguins suffer and decline, it’s likely that other species within the ecosystem are also at risk due to the climate crisis. Emperor penguins forage for krill, fish and squid in the sea, but they also serve as prey for leopard seals and killer whales. “Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the (Biden) Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action,” Williams said. There are about 61 emperor penguin breeding colonies along Antarctica’s coastline, which in total consist of between 270,000 to 280,000 breeding pairs (or 625,000 and 650,000 individual penguins, including juveniles), according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The bird population is currently stable, but research has suggested that the emperor penguin’s population will decrease by 26% to 47% by 2050, or drop to 185,000 or 132,500 breeding pairs, according to the service. Emperor penguins are the tallest and heaviest of the 18 penguin species. They can weigh up to 88 pounds (40 kilograms) and stand 45 inches (1.1 meters) tall. A female emperor lays one egg per breeding season, then passes it over to her male partner to incubate while she forages for food for about a two-month period.'},

As if to emphasise this point, just a few hours after news of the assault on Paul Pelosi on Friday, the US government distributed a bulletin to law enforcement across the nation. It warned of a "heightened threat" of domestic violent extremism against candidates and election workers driven by individuals with "ideological grievances". Also on Friday, the US Department of Justice announced that a man from Pennsylvania had pleaded guilty to making multiple phoned death threats against an unnamed congressman - reported to be Democrat Eric Swalwell of California. The threats included telling a staff member in the congressman Washington office that he was going to come to the US Capitol with a firearm. These wailing klaxons of a political system in peril come as Republicans and Democrats frame the upcoming midterm voting, which will determine which party controls Congress next year, as a pivotal moment in American history. Republicans warn this is the last chance to put a check on Democrat Joe Biden presidency. Democrats say American democracy itself is at stake because of the numerous Republican candidates who have refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election. And the rhetoric comes at the culmination of what has been a steady drumbeat of violence - and violent threats - that has been building all year. In Arizona, there have been multiple reports of masked individuals with firearms staking out ballot drop boxes, ostensibly to monitor the sites for election fraud. They have posted photographs of individuals casting their ballots on right-wing social media sites and encouraged others to join their efforts. In June, a man was arrested near the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He had travelled to the Washington suburb from California and called police after he arrived to tell them he had a firearm and intended to kill the conservative justice. The following month, Republican candidate for governor, Lee Zeldin, was attacked while on stage during a campaign rally. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a liberal leader in the Democratic Party, was threatened by a man with a handgun outside her Seattle home. He was subsequently charged with felony stalking. Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has had police respond to her home six times based on anonymous hoax calls. The practice, called "swatting", is used to try to provoke a confrontation between the target and law enforcement. She has also been the target of numerous death threats. Partisan violence - and the threat of it - is nothing new in American politics, of course. The bloodiest recent attack occurred five years ago, when a man with multiple weapons opened fire on Republican politicians playing baseball at a city park. Five were injured, including one critically - second-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, Steve Scalise of Louisiana. That, however, was an isolated incident.'}]
